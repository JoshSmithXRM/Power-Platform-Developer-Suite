**Status:** Pending review in Phase 4.2

## Purpose

This folder contains documentation that was active before the major refactor.
These docs will be reviewed in **Phase 4.2** to determine:
- ✅ **Keep & Update** - Still relevant but needs updating
- ✅ **Keep As-Is** - Still accurate, move back to docs/
- ❌ **Delete** - Obsolete or contradicts new patterns

## Review Checklist

When reviewing in Phase 4.2, for EACH document ask:

1. **Is this still relevant?**
   - If no → DELETE

2. **Does it contradict new patterns?**
   - If yes → DELETE or UPDATE substantially

3. **Is it still accurate?**
   - If yes → Keep as-is
   - If mostly → Update and move back
   - If no → DELETE

4. **Does it duplicate existing docs?**
   - If yes → Merge or delete duplicate

## Important Reminders for Phase 4.2

1. **Don't rush the review** - Take time to read each doc fully
2. **Test examples** - If doc has code examples, verify they still work
3. **Get second opinion** - Have reviewer agent check decisions
4. **Update incrementally** - Don't try to update everything at once
5. **Commit decisions** - Document WHY you kept/deleted/updated
