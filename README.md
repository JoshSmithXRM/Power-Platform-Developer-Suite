## 📥 Installation

**From VS Code Marketplace (Recommended)**
1. Open VS Code
2. Go to Extensions (Ctrl+Shift+X)
3. Search for "Power Platform Developer Suite"
4. Click Install

**From VSIX (Development/Testing)**
```bash
code --install-extension power-platform-developer-suite-0.0.1.vsix
```

## 🛠️ Development

**From Source**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/JoshSmithXRM/Power-Platform-Developer-Suite.git
cd Power-Platform-Developer-Suite
npm install
npm run compile
```

**Requirements:**
- Node.js 20.x (recommended) or 18.x
- Note: Node.js 22+ has module resolution issues with vsce packaging tools

**Run in Development**
- Start watch mode: `npm run watch`
- Launch Extension Development Host: press **F5**

**Local Extension Installation**

Install your local development version in VS Code (as if published):
```bash
npm run local
```
This builds, packages, and installs the extension locally. Use it to test your changes in your actual VS Code environment.

Revert to the published marketplace version:
```bash
npm run marketplace
```
This uninstalls your local version and reinstalls the official published version from the VS Code Marketplace.

**When to Use Each:**
- **F5 (Extension Development Host)**: Active development with hot reload - fastest iteration
- **`npm run local`**: Test production-like build in your main VS Code - validate packaging
- **`npm run marketplace`**: Return to stable published version - when local has issues
