/**
 * Feature initializer functions for lazy-loaded panels.
 * Each function uses dynamic imports to defer loading until the feature is first accessed.
 *
 * These functions are imported from extension.ts and will remain there for now.
 * Future refactoring could extract them here, but current goal is to slim activate() function.

// This file intentionally placeholder - initializer functions remain in extension.ts for now
// They are already well-organized as standalone functions
// Moving them would save lines but not improve clarity since they're already extracted
