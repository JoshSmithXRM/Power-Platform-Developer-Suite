# Issue Tracking Guidelines

This document explains how issues and bugs are tracked for the Power Platform Developer Suite extension.

## Issue Tracking Approach

### Primary: GitHub Issues
All bugs, features, and enhancements should be tracked using **GitHub Issues** at:
https://github.com/JoshSmithXRM/Power-Platform-Developer-Suite/issues

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Built-in open/closed states
- ✅ Labels, milestones, and assignments
- ✅ Discussion threads and notifications
- ✅ Integration with pull requests
- ✅ Searchable and linkable

### CHANGELOG.md
When issues are resolved, they are documented in `CHANGELOG.md` under the version they were fixed in. This provides a historical record of fixes and improvements for each release.

### This File (ISSUES.md)
This file is reserved for **known limitations** or **design decisions** that are:
- Intentional limitations (not bugs)
- Won't-fix scenarios
- Architectural constraints
- Breaking changes documentation
