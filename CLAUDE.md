# CLAUDE.md - Quick Reference

**Essential rules for AI assistants working on the Power Platform Developer Suite.**

---

## üö´ NEVER (Non-Negotiable)

1. **`any` without explicit type** - Use proper interfaces or `unknown` with narrowing
2. **`eslint-disable` without permission** - Fix root cause. Ask if rule seems wrong
3. **Technical debt shortcuts** - No "quick fixes". Do it right or discuss tradeoffs
4. **Duplicate code 3+ times** - Stop at 2nd copy. Create abstraction (Three Strikes Rule)
5. **Business logic outside domain layer** - Business logic belongs in domain entities/services
6. **Anemic domain models** - Entities must have behavior, not just getters/setters
7. **Domain depending on outer layers** - Domain has ZERO dependencies
8. **Business logic in use cases** - Use cases orchestrate only, no complex logic
9. **Business logic in panels** - Panels call use cases, no logic

---

## ‚úÖ ALWAYS (Required Patterns)

1. **TypeScript strict mode** - Type safety catches bugs at compile time
2. **Clean Architecture layers** - Domain ‚Üí Application ‚Üí Infrastructure/Presentation
3. **Rich domain models** - Entities with behavior (methods), not just data
4. **Use cases orchestrate** - Coordinate domain entities, no business logic
5. **ViewModels for presentation** - DTOs mapped from domain entities
6. **Repository interfaces in domain** - Domain defines contracts, infrastructure implements
7. **Dependency direction inward** - All dependencies point toward domain
8. **Explicit return types** - All public methods have return types
9. **Abstract methods for enforcement** - Make missing implementations compilation errors
10. **Refactor on 2nd duplication** - Don't wait for 3rd

## üí¨ Commenting Rules

**Comment when:**
- ‚úÖ Public/protected methods (JSDoc)
- ‚úÖ WHY, not WHAT (non-obvious decisions)
- ‚úÖ Complex algorithms / Regex

**Never comment:**
- ‚ùå Obvious code
- ‚ùå Placeholders ("Handle event" / "Process data")
- ‚ùå Band-aids for bad code

---

**Development:** `npm run compile` (use this for testing)

**Remember:** Rich domain models with behavior. Business logic in domain, not use cases or panels.
