### Cross-Feature DTO Coupling in Persistence Inspector

**Status**: Deferred
**Priority**: Low
**Effort**: Medium (15-20 minutes)

**Issue:**
The Persistence Inspector infrastructure layer directly references `EnvironmentConnectionDto` from the `environmentSetup` feature to derive secret keys. This creates cross-feature coupling at the infrastructure level.

**Current State:**
```typescript
// VsCodeStorageReader.ts
import { EnvironmentConnectionDto } from '../../../environmentSetup/application/dto/EnvironmentConnectionDto';

public async readAllSecretKeys(): Promise<string[]> {
    const environments = this.globalState.get<EnvironmentConnectionDto[]>(
        VsCodeStorageReader.ENVIRONMENTS_KEY, []
    );
    // Derives secret keys from environment structure
}
```

**Why Deferred:**
- Persistence Inspector is a debug tool that needs to understand environment structure
- Infrastructure-to-infrastructure coupling is acceptable in Clean Architecture
- Only one feature currently needs this pattern
- "Don't abstract until you need it twice" principle

**When to Address:**
- When a 3rd feature needs to read environment data
- When environment DTO structure changes frequently
- During refactoring sprint focused on shared infrastructure

**Recommended Solution:**
1. Create shared DTOs in `src/shared/domain/` or `src/shared/application/`
2. Move environment-related DTOs to shared location
3. Both features reference shared DTOs instead of cross-feature imports
