## Overview

This folder contains comprehensive release notes that supplement the main [CHANGELOG.md](../../CHANGELOG.md). While CHANGELOG.md provides concise user-facing summaries, these release notes offer deeper technical context for developers and contributors.

**Key Differences:**

| CHANGELOG.md | Release Notes (this folder) |
|--------------|----------------------------|
| All releases (including patches) | Major/minor releases only |
| User-facing summary | Technical deep-dive |
| Concise bullet points | Detailed explanations |
| What changed | Why it changed + migration guidance |
