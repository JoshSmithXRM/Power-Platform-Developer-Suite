# Refactor Progress Checklist

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-29
**Current Phase:** Phase 1.3 Complete (✅), Starting Phase 1.4 (Delete Duplicate PanelUtils)

---

## Phase 0: Workflow Setup ✅ COMPLETE

- [x] Enable TypeScript strict mode (already enabled)
- [x] Add ESLint architectural rules (enhanced)
- [x] Simplify CLAUDE.md (543 → 159 lines)
- [x] Create scaffolding templates (templates/ directory)
- [x] Add architectural review checklist (built into CLAUDE.md)

---

## Phase 1: Foundation 🎯 NEXT

### 1.1: BasePanel Abstraction (8 tasks)

**Goal:** Extract component-event handling to BasePanel (~800 lines eliminated)

#### Task 1: Extract Message Validation ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Created `isValidMessage()` method in BasePanel (line 142-153)
- [x] Updated `handleMessageInternal()` to use helper (line 161)
- [x] Compile and test: ✅ npm run compile succeeded
- [x] **Review checkpoint**: 2025-10-29 🔍 APPROVED
- [x] Impact: Eliminates duplicate validation from 4+ child panels

#### Task 2: Extract Component Event Handling - Core Method ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Core method already existed from previous session (line 205-236)
- [x] Enhancement: Added debug logging for componentId, eventType, data (line 208-213)
- [x] Compile and test: ✅ npm run compile succeeded
- [x] **Review checkpoint**: 2025-10-29 🔍 APPROVED
- [x] Impact: Centralizes logging from 4+ child panels (32 lines eliminated)

#### Task 3: Extract Standard Actions Handler ✅ COMPLETED (Pre-existing)
- [x] **Analysis performed**: Only 'refresh' is truly standard across all panels
  - 'refresh': Standard action - used by all panels with consistent behavior (line 888-896)
  - 'export': Panel-specific (2 panels with different data formats - cannot be generalized)
  - 'createNew': Does not exist as action (only as static creation methods)
- [x] Implementation: handleStandardActions() correctly implements refresh only
- [x] Delegation pattern: Returns boolean for handled/not-handled → delegates to handlePanelAction()
- [x] Compile and test: ✅ npm run compile succeeded

## Documentation Strategy 📚

### Living Documentation (During Refactor)
As you implement each phase, update docs in real-time:

**Phase 1 (Foundation):**
- When you finish Phase 1.1: Update `docs/patterns/DETAILED_PATTERNS.md` with new BasePanel hooks
- When you finish Phase 1.2: Create example in `docs/patterns/SERVICE_TYPE_SAFETY.md`
- When you finish Phase 1.3: Update `docs/patterns/DETAILED_PATTERNS.md` BaseBehavior section

**Why:** Don't wait until Phase 4 to document. Document while context is fresh.

**How:**
- After each major task (not every small task), ask: "Should I document this?"
- If yes, create/update relevant doc file
- Keep it brief - just enough for next developer to understand

### Final Documentation Review (Phase 4.2)
- Audit OLD/ folder for what to keep/delete/update
- Ensure all new patterns are documented
- Create unified navigation
- Delete anything obsolete or contradictory

3. **2024-10-29:** Taking it slow - one phase at a time
4. **2024-10-29:** Moved all docs to OLD/ - will audit in Phase 4.2
