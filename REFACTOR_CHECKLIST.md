## How to Use This Checklist

1. **Pick ONE unchecked task**
2. **Builder implements it** (30-60 min)
3. **Reviewer reviews it** (10-15 min)
4. **Check the box** when approved
5. **Commit** with review note
6. **Repeat**

## Progress Tracking

**Phase 0:** ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà 100% (5/5 tasks)
**Phase 1:** ‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë 0% (0/25 tasks)

## Documentation Strategy üìö

### Living Documentation (During Refactor)
As you implement each phase, update docs in real-time:

**Phase 1 (Foundation):**
- When you finish Phase 1.1: Update `docs/patterns/DETAILED_PATTERNS.md` with new BasePanel hooks
- When you finish Phase 1.2: Create example in `docs/patterns/SERVICE_TYPE_SAFETY.md`
- When you finish Phase 1.3: Update `docs/patterns/DETAILED_PATTERNS.md` BaseBehavior section

**Why:** Don't wait until Phase 4 to document. Document while context is fresh.

**How:**
- After each major task (not every small task), ask: "Should I document this?"
- If yes, create/update relevant doc file
- Keep it brief - just enough for next developer to understand

### Final Documentation Review (Phase 4.2)
- Audit OLD/ folder for what to keep/delete/update
- Ensure all new patterns are documented
- Create unified navigation
- Delete anything obsolete or contradictory

## Notes & Decisions

### Decision Log
1. **2024-10-29:** Using 2-agent workflow (Builder + Reviewer)
2. **2024-10-29:** Commit after each approved task (not batching)
3. **2024-10-29:** Taking it slow - one phase at a time
4. **2024-10-29:** Moved all docs to OLD/ - will audit in Phase 4.2
5. **2024-10-29:** Living documentation - update as we go, not just at end
